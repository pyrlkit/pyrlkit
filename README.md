## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

A python library for reinforcement learning in which all the environments and agents can be customised. A high level abstraction meant to reduce the amoutn of code written, while providing robustness and versatility if one wants to tune the scenarios firther
We mean to create two versions of this library, one written in python purely and one more lua

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Once written, this library will be uploaded to pip/PyPi and users will be able to access the library.

### Prerequisites

All dependencies will be installled via the pip package 

### Installing

A simple `pip install pyrlkit` should install the library, once it is up and running


## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Documentation on the library will be made separately and hosted, it will be linked here in the future
