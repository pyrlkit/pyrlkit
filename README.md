## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>

A Python library for reinforcement learning in which all the environments and agents can be customized. It offers a high-level abstraction intended to reduce the amount of code written, while providing robustness and versatility for users who wish to further fine-tune their scenarios.
We intend to create two versions of this library: one written purely in Python and another in Lua.

## 🏁 Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

Once written, this library will be uploaded to pip/PyPi and users will be able to access the library.

### Prerequisites

All dependencies will be installled via the pip package

### Installing

A simple `pip install pyrlkit` should install the library, once it is up and running

## 🎈 Usage <a name="usage"></a>

Documentation for the library will be created separately and hosted. It will be linked here in the future.
